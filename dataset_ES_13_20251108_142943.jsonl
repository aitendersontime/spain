The model allows to study the effects of taxes and social benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population of each country and for the EU as a whole. EUROMOD is unique in its area as it features a great flexibility in the scope of its simulation and ensures cross-country consistency of the modelling approach and comparability of the results. The model has increasingly been used by the Commission services over the past few years, particularly so in the European Semester context. Additionally, the model represents a valuable research infrastructure for the academic community in the area of fiscal policy analysis, with highly cited research conducted using EUROMOD being published in top journals.
